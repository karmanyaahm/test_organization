More announcements will be here soon  
* 5: Protein modeling is spelled wrong and I'm not fixing like 40 files now and the "it's" in about time is intentionally spelled "its" to prevent quotes in filenames
* 4: An example of a mistake is that for some reason some div b meteorology tests were labeled entomology. Why ... I have no idea --update "some crime_busters were also labeled codebusters and I'm assuming that's because of the similarity comparison that I implemented originally but have now removed"
* 3: If you have any new (or old) tests that this repository could benefit from, please send them to 23kmalhotra@beachwoodstudents.org
* 2: Any changes made on Google Drive won't stay so contact 23kmalhotra@beachwoodstudents.org to make any changes.
* 1: The categories, especially for biology and earth_science, are not great. Please contact 23kmalhotra@beachwoodstudents.org if you can contribute or have any potential improvements/suggestions.
* 0: This is the announcements page for this test repo
